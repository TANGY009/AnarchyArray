# 🌌 **AnarchyArray**

> [!NOTE]  
> 💡 Original concept credited and thanks to [Max‑RM](https://github.com/Max-RM), who first discovered this on Windows.<br>
> 📝 The Android signatures were later found by me

> [!CAUTION]  
> ⚠️ **ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK — these modules are chaos engines.**  
>  
> 🚫 Do **NOT** load survival saves, long‑term builds, or worlds you care about.  
> 🔥 These mechanics are instant, global, and irreversible.  
> 📈 Playing with them will **massively increase world size**.  
> 🧨 Expect terrain collapse, fluid chaos, and total instability.  
>  
> 👉 Use **only** in disposable test worlds. Embrace the destruction.

> [!WARNING]  
> ⚠️ **Disable tile drops** — otherwise performance will nosedive into unplayable lag.
